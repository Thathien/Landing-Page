        3. Add a Function using an if statement and getBoundingClientRect Method to determine which section is on the view to give it a special class so it is clear to the user that this is the actual section they want, and At the same time it also provides an activity class for the Section button in the NavBar to better know what the actual section the user has selected is.

        4. Add functionality to toggle navigation bar visibility according to user interaction with the website using setTimeOut Method

        5. Both the activeSection Function and the handleNavList Function are called in the Scroll event listener to be executed.
